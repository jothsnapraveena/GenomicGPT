# 🔬 GenomicGPT: Framework for Gene Disease Relationship

🚀 **Harvard Rare Disease Hackathon 2025**  


---

## 📌 Overview
**GenomicGPT** is an AI-driven framework designed to automate gene-disease research by integrating:
✅ **Automated literature retrieval** (NCBI Bookshelf, PubMed)  
✅ **AI-powered summarization** using LLMs (GPT-4)  
✅ **Confidence scoring** for gene-disease associations  

Our goal is to streamline **rare disease diagnosis & genetic research** with AI.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
### 🚨 Challenges in Gene-Disease Research:
- **Scattered Literature**: Research is fragmented across multiple sources.  
- **No Standard Confidence Metric**: No quantitative confidence score for associations.  
- **Limited Accessibility**: Non-experts struggle to interpret genetic findings.

## 🏆 Solution: GenomicGPT
### 🔍 Key Features:
1️⃣ **Fetches highly cited research articles** from NCBI Bookshelf & PubMed  
2️⃣ **Uses LLMs (GPT-4) for summarization & disease mechanism extraction**  
3️⃣ **Assigns confidence scores** to gene-disease associations based on citations & literature consistency

## 🛠 Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| 🏗 LangChain | RAG-based document retrieval & summarization |
| 🤖 OpenAI GPT-4 | AI-powered synthesis |
| 🗄 ChromaDB | Vector search for document retrieval |
| 📊 Machine Learning | Confidence scoring |

## 🖥 How It Works?
1️⃣ **Fetch research articles** → Uses **SerpAPI & NCBI Bookshelf Scraper**  
2️⃣ **Extracts summaries using GPT-4** → Mechanism of disease, before/after mutation effects  
3️⃣ **Confidence scoring** → Based on **citations, consistency, and AI-validated justifications**
